## 発表内容

## Development of a Context-Aware Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention for Promoting Physical Activity

Takahiro Okada, Otoha Mitsumatsu, Jerome C. Foo, Yusuke Yamamoto, Jinhyuk Kim

Maintaining regular physical activity (PA) is difficult, but individually tailored just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) is known to be effective in increasing PA 
levels. Here, we developed and evaluated a JITAI system that uses individual contexts (e.g., weather, daily schedule, and mood) to promote PA. The system delivers personalized messages considering individual contexts when PA declines. A controlled trial showed context-aware JITAI was more effective than no-context JITAI for maintaining PA.

## Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Psychological Stress Using Biological Data in Daily Life

Otoha Mitsumatsu, Takahiro Okada, Jerome C. Foo, Fumiharu Togo, Jinhyuk Kim

Psychological stress (PS) in daily life can be monitored using passively collected heart rate variability (HRV) data. This study classified PS levels based on HRV recorded over two weeks from 17 participants, who self-reported PS seven times a day. HRV features from various time windows were analyzed using machine learning. The best model, LightGBM, achieved an AUC of 76% in predicting whether PS was above or below each individual's average.
